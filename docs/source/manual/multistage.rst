Multistage
===========

The class `DLD` from ``mnflow.mfda.cad.dld.theme.multistage`` 
`(multistage.DLD)` aims at configuring a DLD system with multiple stages, 
wherein each stage can be potentially a **full** DLD block, completely 
displacing sufficiently large particles towards its accumulation sidewall.
Different stages can have different configurations including gap, diameter, 
pillar shape, etc.
More information about this scheme can be found from `Davis et. al. (2006) <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0605967103>`_.
