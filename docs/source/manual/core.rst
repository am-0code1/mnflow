Core
-----

The core of a DLD system is a single DLD unit. 
The class `DLD` from ``mnflow.mfda.cad.dld.theme.core`` `(core.DLD)` aims at configuring the core of a DLD system: the entities (pillars) of each DLD unit.
The DLD unit can be arrayed later in child classes, e.g., ``mnflow.mfda.cad.dld.theme.block.DLD``, to make more complex designs and/or full DLD devices.
